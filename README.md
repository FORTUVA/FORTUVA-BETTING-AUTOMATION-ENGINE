# FORTUVA-BETTING-AUTOMATION-ENGINE

An open-source helper tool for **Fortuva Prediction** players on Solana.  
This enginee does **not** predict market direction ‚Äî it simply places bets automatically in the direction you choose, so you can focus on your own strategy.

## üîê Safe Private Key Handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This enginee runs locally on your computer. Your private key never leaves your device, and no external services collect or store it. However, always use a dedicated wallet with only the SOL you're willing to use for betting. Never use your primary wallet for automated tools.

### üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

#### 1. Create a Dedicated enginee Wallet
- **Generate a new Solana wallet** specifically for enginee operations
- **Never use your main wallet** or any wallet containing significant funds
- **Fund it only** with the amount you're willing to risk for betting

#### 2. Secure Private Key Storage
- **Environment Variables**: Store your private key in a `.env` file (never commit this file)
- **File Permissions**: Ensure `.env` file has restricted access (600 permissions on Unix systems)
- **Backup Securely**: Keep a secure backup of your enginee wallet's private key

#### 3. Wallet Separation Strategy

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **npm**: Package manager
- **Solana Wallet**: With SOL for betting
- **TypeScript**: For development and compilation

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sol-prediction-simple-enginee
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Solana wallet private key (base58 encoded)
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   
   # Solana RPC URL (optional - defaults to devnet)
   RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Core Configuration (`src/config.ts`)

```typescript
// Network Configuration
export const RPC_URL = process.env.RPC_URL || "https://api.devnet.solana.com"; // Now configurable via environment variable. Change to mainnet RPC (e.g., "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com") for production use
export const PROGRAM_ID = "2fW8rcHAShyHDSKdVwnLb3tuhXvxp3JUtxfAPKPgybiA";
export const API_URL = "https://engineeapi.fortuva.xyz";

// Timing Configuration
export const BET_TIME = 10; // Seconds before round lock to place bet
export const INTERVAL_TIME = 5; // Seconds between enginee checks

// Betting Strategy Configuration
export const EVEN_MIN_BET_AMOUNT = 0.01; // Minimum bet for even rounds
export const EVEN_MAX_BET_AMOUNT = 1;     // Maximum bet for even rounds
export const EVEN_MULTIPLIER = 2.1;       // Multiplier for bet amount after failed bets. Set to 1 for consistent bet amounts (no increase after losses)
export const EVEN_MODE: MODE_TYPE = "GENERAL"; // Betting mode GENERAL| PAYOUT
export const EVEN_DIRECTION: DIRECTION_TYPE = "DOWN"; // Betting direction

export const ODD_MIN_BET_AMOUNT = 0.01;   // Minimum bet for odd rounds
export const ODD_MAX_BET_AMOUNT = 1;       // Maximum bet for odd rounds
export const ODD_MULTIPLIER = 2;         // Multiplier for bet amount after failed bets. Set to 1 for consistent bet amounts (no increase after losses)
export const ODD_MODE: MODE_TYPE = "PAYOUT"; // Betting mode GENERAL| PAYOUT
export const ODD_DIRECTION: DIRECTION_TYPE = "UP"; // When MODE_TYPE is "PAYOUT", 'UP' means bet in the direction which its payout is bigger

export const CONSIDERING_OLD_BETS = false; // Determines bet amount calculation strategy: true includes historical wallet bets, false starts fresh from current round
```

### Betting Modes

- **GENERAL**: Always bets in the configured direction (UP/DOWN)
- **PAYOUT**: Bets in the direction that has the bigger payout potential. When DIRECTION_TYPE is 'UP', it means bet in the direction which its payout is bigger

## üéÆ Usage

### Real-time Bet Monitoring

**Important**: Users can connect their enginee wallet to Fortuva App (https://app.fortuva.xyz) and they can see the real time bet status on the frontend in real time.

### Starting the enginee

```bash
# Start the main enginee
npm start

# Or run directly with ts-node
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

### Interactive Controls

While the enginee is running, you can use keyboard controls:

- **Press 'S' or 's'**: Enter manual betting mode
- **Format**: `DIRECTION/AMOUNT` (e.g., `UP/0.01` or `DOWN/0.02`)
- **Type 'exit'**: Exit the interactive input mode and return to enginee mode
- **Ctrl+C**: Exit the enginee completely

### Manual Betting Example

```
[INPUT] Enter direction and amount (e.g., UP/0.01 or DOWN/0.02): UP/0.05
[INPUT] Direction set to UP, bet amount set to 0.05 SOL in Round #1234
```

**Exiting Interactive Mode:**
```
[INPUT] Enter direction and amount (e.g., UP/0.01 or DOWN/0.02): exit
[INPUT] Input cancelled.
```

### Claiming Rewards

```bash
# Run the claim script separately
npm run claim

# Or run directly
npx ts-node src/claimAll.ts
```

### Automatic Bet Management

The enginee includes comprehensive bet management features that run automatically every 60 seconds:

#### Bet Cancellation
- **Automatic Detection**: Fetches cancelable bets from the Fortuva API
- **Refund Processing**: Cancels eligible bets and processes refunds to your wallet
- **Balance Tracking**: Monitors balance changes to confirm refund amounts
- **Logging**: Detailed logs with transaction signatures and refund amounts

#### Bet Closing
- **Account Cleanup**: Automatically closes completed bets to free up account space
- **Gas Optimization**: Reduces storage costs by cleaning up old bet accounts
- **Transaction Logging**: Logs all close operations with transaction signatures

#### Reward Claiming
- **Winning Bet Detection**: Identifies all winning bets eligible for claiming
- **Automatic Payout**: Claims rewards for all winning bets automatically
- **Balance Updates**: Tracks balance increases from claimed rewards
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all claim operations with amounts and signatures

### Bet Management Workflow

1. **Every 60 seconds**, the enginee automatically:
   - Claims rewards from winning bets
   - Cancels eligible bets and processes refunds
   - Closes completed bets to free account space

2. **API Integration**: Uses Fortuva's API to:
   - Fetch claimable bets (`/user/claimable-bet/{wallet}`)
   - Fetch cancelable bets (`/user/cancelable-bets/{wallet}`)
   - Fetch closeable bets (`/user/closesable-bets/{wallet}`)

3. **Transaction Processing**: Each operation:
   - Creates and signs the appropriate Solana transaction
   - Submits to the blockchain with proper error handling
   - Confirms transaction success
   - Logs results with transaction signatures

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures:
   - Failed operations don't stop the enginee
   - Individual bet failures are logged but don't affect other operations
   - Network issues are handled gracefully

The updated folder structure now accurately reflects the current project organization with:

1. **Organized subdirectories**: `api/`, `config/`, `core/`, `services/`, `types/`, and `utils/`
2. **Service-based architecture**: Separate services for betting, claiming, input handling, logging, and user input
3. **Modular configuration**: Configuration split into constants, types, and index files
4. **Utility organization**: Blockchain utilities, helpers, and general utilities separated
5. **Type organization**: Betting-specific types in their own directory
6. **Added package-lock.json**: Included the dependency lock file

This structure shows a much more organized and maintainable codebase compared to the previous flat structure.

## üéØ enginee Logic

### Betting Strategy

1. **Round Analysis**: Determines if current round is odd or even
2. **Strategy Selection**: Applies different strategies based on round number
3. **Bet Calculation**: 
   - Base amount from configuration
   - Multiplied by failed bet count
   - Capped at maximum bet amount
4. **Direction Decision**:
   - Uses runtime direction if manually set
   - Otherwise uses configured strategy (GENERAL/PAYOUT)
5. **Timing**: Places bet near the end of each round (configurable via BET_TIME in config.ts - can be adjusted to bet at any time during the 180-second round duration)

### Failed Bet Recovery

The enginee implements a Martingale-like strategy:
- Tracks consecutive failed bets for each round type (odd/even)
- Multiplies bet amount by configured multiplier after each loss
- Resets to base amount after a win

### Automatic Claiming

- Runs every 60 seconds
- Fetches claimable bets from API
- Claims rewards for all winning bets
- Logs claimed amounts and new balance

### Automatic Bet Management

The enginee includes comprehensive bet management features that run automatically every 60 seconds:

#### Bet Cancellation
- **Automatic Detection**: Fetches cancelable bets from the Fortuva API
- **Refund Processing**: Cancels eligible bets and processes refunds to your wallet
- **Balance Tracking**: Monitors balance changes to confirm refund amounts
- **Logging**: Detailed logs with transaction signatures and refund amounts

#### Bet Closing
- **Account Cleanup**: Automatically closes completed bets to free up account space
- **Gas Optimization**: Reduces storage costs by cleaning up old bet accounts

#### Reward Claiming
- **Winning Bet Detection**: Identifies all winning bets eligible for claiming
- **Automatic Payout**: Claims rewards for all winning bets automatically
